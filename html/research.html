                <br>
                <p>A corpus study of closural features in the atonal music of Arnold Schoenberg, Anton Webern, and Alban Berg, conducted in partnership with <a href="https://music.osu.edu/people/huron.1" target="_blank">David Huron</a>. Works of similar genre that were composed around the same time were chosen for each of the three composers. For each of these works, closural moments are identified according to pre-determined criteria (double bar lines, fermatas, and general pauses). These "closural-moments" are then examined for certain "secondary parameters" that tend to be associated with closure in tonal music (things like pitch descent, longer duration, change in textural density, change in dynamic leve, etc.) Our overarching hypothesis is that these secondary closural features found in tonal music will continue to be important in atonal music, and may in fact move to the fore as the only means of achieving closure.</p>

                <br>
                <p>A survey of transformational literature dealing with triadic music—especially the work of Richard Cohn might give one the impression that transformational theory is only relevant in triadic contexts when major and minor triads alternate systematically. Such progressions invite a transformational approach because they produce highly organized voice leading that cannot be explained by tonal syntax. While these progressions do occur frequently in late-romantic music, it should be obvious that they do not account for all non-tonal triadic progressions. Nor can it be said that progressions of alternating major and minor triads provide the only means for systematically traversing voice-leading space. In this paper, I suggest that Cohn’s (1998) work with “sum classes” offers the beginnings of a system for understanding virtually any non-tonal triadic progression in terms of its voice leading and demonstrates that different background voice-leading structures can be expressed in various, seemingly different, surface realizations. In particular, I show that progressions of same-mode triads can also be used to produce consistent, small-interval voice leading. Charles Villiers Stanford’s dramatic ballade <em>La belle Dame sans merci</em> provides two prominent examples of triadic progressions in which same-mode triads produce systematic voice leading that suggests a transformational approach. Here, I explore the possibilities and implications of the sum-class system in the context of <em>La belle Dame</em> and propose small modifications to that system that make its generalizations more universally applicable. In particular, I note that, while neo-Riemannian transformations are a valuable tool for comparing triads of different mode, I argue that they do not provide an intuitive notion of the “distance” between triads of the same mode. Perhaps the greatest strength of this modified system lies in its ability to describe those non-tonal triadic succession that appear to be highly ordered but do not make sense in a hexatonic, octatonic, or other previously defined transformational space. Progressions of same-mode triads—as explored here—are one possible context, but such a concept might be applied to a variety of tonal and post-tonal settings.</p>

                <br>
                <p>Though certainly tonal in many respects, Aton Webern's early string quartet experiment from 1905 also appears to explore atonality in some highly significant, though subtle, ways. This becomes particularly clear through the lens of Hepokoski and Darcy's Sonata Theory. By carefully choosing the key centers for important themes and cadences, Webern is actually able to use tonal centricity to unmoor the quartet's fundamental sonata structure from the bonds of tonality. In lieu of tonality's unifying force, Webern builds the structure around the set class 3-3 (014); a motive that proves to be important throughout the quartet. By breaking free from tonality at the deepest levels of structure, Webern paves the way for the composition of unified music without reference to any tonal center at all.</p>

                <h2 class="section_title">Serialism in Three Chamber Works of Reginald Smith Brindle</h2>
                <br>
                <p>This paper examines the usage of serial techniques in three of Reginald Smith Brindle’s chamber pieces for guitar—Tierra Seca from Four Poems of Garcia Lorca, the first movement of Ten-String Music for cello and guitar, and Lachrimae from Five Sketches for violin and guitar—in light of Brindle’s own writings about serialism in his 1966 book Serial Composition. The attitude toward serialism that Brindle articulates in this book is a very skeptical one, and he mainly advocates for the use of serial techniques for their practical compositional and pedagogical value rather than the ideological merit often attached to them by the composers of the Second Viennese School. Specifically, Brindle finds that the absorption of serial techniques is a very effective way to teach the budding composer to write in an atonal musical language and that a tone row can provide the more experienced composer with musical material with which to work during the early stages of the compositional process. But Brindle also identifies several “defects” in music produced by the strict adherence to serial techniques and thus advocates for a more liberal approach to the ordering of pitch classes in a tone row. This practice is particularly evident in Ten-String Music where the presence of tone rows are quite evident but the pitch classes within them frequently appear out of order. From the pieces examined in this presentation, it seems that whether Brindle follows serial practices strictly—as in Tierra Seca where he utilizes a tone row and derives all pitch material from that row or one of its transformations—or liberally—as in Ten-String Music where only portions of the work are constructed from a tone row and those that are often contain modifications to the row ordering—, his reasons for doing so arise from the needs of the individual piece, rather than from some belief in the superiority of such methods. The freedom with which Brindle treats the series suggests that serial practices may have been at play during the compositional process of many of Brindle’s works, even those that do not seem to exhibit serial characteristics on the surface. While the row from which Brindle worked may not always be present on a note-to-note level in such cases, the analysis of Lachrimae suggests that many of the row’s larger pitch structures may still be present in the music. Above all, the findings of this presentation suggest that serial techniques need not always be used in the strict and uncompromising way that they are normally presented and that we as theorists might look for traces of serialism in a variety of musical contexts.</p>

                <br>
                <p>This paper examines the form of the first movement of Edvard Grieg's G-minor string quartet in terms of Hepokoski and Darcy's three-part, "tri-modular block" expositional structure. Approaching the movement from this paradigm helps to reconcile the profusion of seemingly unrelated themes into a single unified sonata whole. Such an interpretation also allows for suggestive readings of the quartet's narrative in light of many interesting connections to Grieg's biography and oeuvre.</p>

                <br>
                <p>Stephen Malinowksi's musical animations of scrolling color and shapes have delighted viewers for over a decade. Yet these animations go far deeper than many people likely realize. Through these animations, Malinowski hopes to help people to hear and understand the music in a new and more meaningful way. In this paper, I examine in detail Malinowski's use of color to depict tonal structures in the music he animates. I argue that these colored animations, rather than being a mere gimick, can actually help us as listeners to hear important tonal structures in the music that would otherwise go unnoticed without the visuals. In this way, Malinowski helps us to actually hear and experience in real time tonal structures that could otherwise only be brought out through careful analysis.</p>

                <br>
                <p>As of late there has been much interest in the creative process of musical composition. Most studies to date have taken the form of quantitative and/or psychological analyses performed upon composers by researchers who are not themselves composers. In contrast, this project takes a more philosophical and historical approach in that it takes time to reflect upon the context and manner in which music has been composed throughout history. Additionally, this study offers a more personal perspective as it draws information from the author’s own compositional process–as recorded in a composition journal–as well as the thoughts and reflections of composers throughout history. From this information, the essential elements of the compositional process–that is, the elements present in the compositional processes of all composers throughout time–are delineated and several conclusions are drawn about the nature of the compositional process and creativity in general. From these conclusions, several practical suggestions may be made, which might enhance compositional creativity. Of the conclusions reached in this study, perhaps the most important is the pervasiveness of boundaries–limitations intentionally or unintentionally placed upon the compositional process–within the compositional process. Indeed, it has been concluded that without boundaries of some form, composition would be virtually impossible. Beyond this, however, boundaries help to focus a composer’s creative efforts and, in fact, make the composer more creative than they would have been otherwise. This would seem to suggest that, in sharp contrast to popular opinion, creativity lies not in freedom but rather in the manner in which freedom is limited. This, in turn, might suggest a new paradigm through which musical composition–and possibly all creative practices–might be understood and taught.</p>
