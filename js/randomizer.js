    "Serialism in Three Chamber Works of Reginald Smith Brindle": ["This paper examines the usage of serial techniques in three of Reginald Smith Brindle’s chamber pieces for guitar—Tierra Seca from Four Poems of Garcia Lorca, the first movement of Ten-String Music for cello and guitar, and Lachrimae from Five Sketches for violin and guitar—in light of Brindle’s own writings about serialism in his 1966 book Serial Composition...", "/html/research.html#brindle"], 
    "Ex Nihilo: An Inquiry into the Nature of Musical Composition": ["As of late there has been much interest in the creative process of musical composition. Most studies to date have taken the form of quantitative and/or psychological analyses performed upon composers by researchers who are not themselves composers. In contrast, this project takes a more philosophical and historical approach in that it takes time to reflect upon the context and manner in which music has been composed throughout history. Additionally, this study offers a more personal perspective as it draws information from the author’s own compositional process–as recorded in a composition journal–as well as the thoughts and reflections of composers throughout history...", "/html/research.html#ex_nihilo"], 
    "Sonata Form in the First Movement of Edvard Grieg's String Quartet in G Minor, Op. 27": ["This paper examines the form of the first movement of Edvard Grieg's G-minor string quartet in terms of Hepokoski and Darcy's three-part, 'tri-modular block' expositional structure. Approaching the movement from this paradigm helps to reconcile the profusion of seemingly unrelated themes into a single unified sonata whole. Such an interpretation also allows for suggestive readings of the quartet's narrative in light of many interesting connections to Grieg's biography and oeuvre...", "/html/research.html#grieg"], 
    "The Visualization of Tonality Through Color in the Animations of Stephen Malinowski": ["Stephen Malinowksi's musical animations of scrolling color and shapes have delighted viewers for over a decade. Yet these animations go far deeper than many people likely realize. Through these animations, Malinowski hopes to help people to hear and understand the music in a new and more meaningful way. In this paper, I examine in detail Malinowski's use of color to depict tonal structures in the music he animates. I argue that these colored animations, rather than being a mere gimick, can actually help us as listeners to hear important tonal structures in the music that would otherwise go unnoticed without the visuals. In this way, Malinowski helps us to actually hear and experience in real time tonal structures that could otherwise only be brought out through careful analysis...", "/html/research.html#malinowski"], 
    "Exploring Cohn's Sum-Class System Through Charles Villiers Stanford's <em>La belle Dame sans merci</em>": ["In this paper, I suggest that Cohn’s (1998) work with “sum classes” offers the beginnings of a system for understanding virtually any non-tonal triadic progression in terms of its voice leading and demonstrates that different background voice-leading structures can be expressed in various, seemingly different, surface realizations...", "/html/research.html#sum_class"], 
    "Form Generating Elements in Anton Webern's String Quartet (1905)": ["This paper takes as its starting point Sebastian Wedler’s suggestion in his 2015 article, “Thus Spoke the Early Modernist: Zarathustra and Rotational Form in Webern’s String Quartet (1905)” that Anton Webern’s 1905 string quartet might be profitably examined through the lens of sonata form—particularly the theories of Hepokoski and Darcy. Even a cursory examination of the work, however, reveals that such an interpretation is fraught with perils. Indeed, anyone attempting to understand the quartet from this perspective is forced to wrestle with significant formal deformations that strike at the very heart of a sonata’s fundamental structure and rhetorical power—the conflict between the tonal centers of the primary and secondary thematic areas. Where Welder is content to merely label this work as some sort of vague “dialogue with the sonata paradigm” and continue on to a discussion of the quartet’s place within the philosophical Zeitgeist of the early-twentieth century, the present paper seeks, instead, to investigate the implications of such deformations on Webern’s later music, the music of Schoenberg, and the development of atonal composition as a whole. Specifically, this paper finds that the quartet relies heavily upon inversional symmetry and the composing out of a fundamental motive—both highly important techniques in later atonal music—for the generation of form...", "/html/research.html#webern"], 
    "Non-Syntactical Closural Features in Atonal Music by Schoenberg, Webern, and Berg": ["This paper examines the role that secondary parameters like duration, pauses, dynamics, texture, pitch height, and consonance play in the articulation of closure in a corpus of 33 works by Schoenberg, Webern, and Berg. For each of these pieces a “closural moment” was defined, a priori, as any sonority: 1) immediately before the final double bar at the end of a movement or whole work, 2) immediately before or after an internal double bar, 3) immediately before or during a fermata, or 4) immediately before a rest in all parts of a half duration or longer. At each of these deemed closural moments, data was collected about duration, the presence or absence of rests (except when the closural moment was identified by the presence of a rest), dynamics, textural density, pitch height, and harmonic consonance. Upon analysis, this data indicates that there is a statistically-significant correlation between moments of closure and sonorities that exhibit comparatively longer durations, quieter dynamics, thinner textures, and that are followed by a rest in all parts. That these same characteristics are also found at moments of closure in tonal music perhaps indicates that composers of non-tonal music were unable to find a non-tonal analogue to the tonal cadence and were thus forced to rely upon those cadential characteristics not explicitly associated with a tonal center. Furthermore, this also speaks to the universality with which secondary parameters like longer durations, quieter dynamics, thinner textures, and pauses are associated with closure in the Western mind...", "/html/research.html#atonal_close"],
    "The Study of Music at the University of Oxford in the Twelfth and Thirteenth Centuries": ["Music, as one of the quadrivial disciplines of the seven liberal arts, had played a vital role in early-medieval education by preparing the mind of the student for theological study. With the re-discovery of the writings of Greek writers like Aristotle in the twelfth century, however, came a educational renaissance of sorts that appears to have pushed the quadrivial arts toward the background of the arts curriculum, at least at the University of Paris. Indeed, by 1255, it appears that lectures on musical texts are no longer required of in the liberal arts course at Paris. Because of the similarities between Paris and the University of Oxford, most scholars to date have tended to assume that this situation was true of Oxford as well. By 1431, however, music appears to have re-entered the arts curriculum at Oxford—something that did not happen at Paris. This, along with a thriving mathematical culture at Oxford during its early days, suggests that music continued to be studied at Oxford, perhaps unofficially, throughout the twelfth and thirteenth centuries even when it was not required in the official university statutes...", "/html/research.html#oxford"],
    "Inversion as Rotation in Ordered Pitch-Class Sets": ["The vast majority of pitch-class sets are 'rotationally symmetric' about their normal form, meaning that at set in normal form will remain in normal form when inverted (though read backwards). In the process of finding a set's prime form it is necessary to compare the normal form of the set with the normal form of its inversion to find the 'best normal form.' For rotationally-symmetric sets, one can simply retrograde the inverted set to find its normal form. There exactly 50 non-trivial cases, however, in which the retrograde of the inverted set is <em>not</em> the normal form of the inverted set. In some cases these sets are still rotationally symmetric but about a rotation other than the normal form, but for sets of even cardinality (4, 6, 8), it is possible for a set to have no axis of rotational symmetry (like the major-major seventh chord, 4-20). This paper attempts to classify the behavior of these sets and to explain why some sets exhibit this property while others do not...", "/html/research.html#inversion"]
